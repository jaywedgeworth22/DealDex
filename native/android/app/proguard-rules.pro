# R8 keep rules for the release build.
#
# R8 is enabled here for the first time, in the same change that adds
# androidx.security:security-crypto.  That combination needs care: Tink (which
# backs EncryptedSharedPreferences) registers its key managers REFLECTIVELY over
# shaded protobuf types, and R8 in full mode strips them.  The failure mode is
# nasty rather than loud — `EncryptedSharedPreferences.create` throws, Prefs
# falls back, and the credential store degrades silently.  Prefs now falls back
# to memory rather than a plaintext file (see Prefs.kt), but the right answer is
# to not strip Tink in the first place.
