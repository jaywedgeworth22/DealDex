# DealDex

Find the best-priced Pokémon card listings.  Scan live eBay and Mercari Buy It Now singles, then score the ask against TCGPlayer, Cardmarket, TCGCSV, eBay solds, and optional paid desks (JustTCG, PriceCharting, pokemontcg.io).

Website name: **DealDex**.  Android and iPhone apps scan on the device.  They do not wrap the website.  API keys live on the phone; scanning never sends one and the scan endpoint refuses a keys payload outright.  The only time a key leaves the phone is an explicit Push Phone Keys to Account.  A scan on the **website** runs on the server, so keys saved in the browser are sent with the request; if you want no key to leave your device, use the phone apps.  Sign-in is optional if you want an encrypted backup.

## Source of truth

GitHub **`main`** is the product: [jaywedgeworth22/DealDex](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/DealDex).  The repo is public.  Work lands through a pull request.  Do not push straight to `main`.

Anyone working on DealDex (this preview, another Grok chat, Claude, Cursor, Copilot) must:

1. `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`
2. Make the change on a seat branch
3. Open a PR and merge when CI is green

Full loop: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Website

The website is optional.  The phone apps do not wrap it.

This repo's web app is React 19, TanStack Start, Tailwind v4, and Better Auth (Vite).  It is not Next.js, Expo, React Native, or Capacitor.

**Public host: https://dealdex.net on Vercel.**  Vercel is current, not a leftover.  GitHub About homepage is that URL.  Do not use `dealdex-psi.vercel.app` as the homepage.  Do not migrate the site to Coolify.

The app's default `VITE_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` is `dealdex.net`.  Owner registered that name 2026-08-22 (Namecheap).  `https://dealdex.vercel.app` is a different Next.js site titled "DealDeX - Revolutionizing E-commerce" and is not this repo.

Do not invent another live URL.

## Datadog (existing US5 account)

The website ships logs, APM traces, and browser RUM to the existing Datadog
account (`DD_SITE=us5.datadoghq.com`).  Production is fail-closed without
`DD_API_KEY`.  Missing `DD_APPLICATION_ID` / `DD_CLIENT_TOKEN` leave RUM
dark and do not 503 the site.  Reuse the names already used by the Datadog
Vercel integration and the fleet agent.  Do not commit values.

- `DD_API_KEY` (alias `DATADOG_API_KEY`) — server logs + traces
- `DD_SITE` — defaults to `us5.datadoghq.com`
- `DD_SERVICE` — defaults to `dealdex`
- `DD_ENV`, `DD_VERSION`
- `DD_APPLICATION_ID` (alias `VITE_DD_APPLICATION_ID`) — browser RUM
- `DD_CLIENT_TOKEN` (alias `VITE_DD_CLIENT_TOKEN`) — browser RUM + browser logs

Do not turn on Vercel log/trace drains (those are billed by Vercel).  Do not
replace Sentry or PagerDuty.  iOS has no Datadog RUM SDK in this repo; adding
one would need a Mac `xcodebuild` and is out of scope.

Scan hop timing prefers **Sentry Performance** (org credit is the roomier
budget; Datadog free APM stays one `web.request` parent).  Server spans:

- `scan` (parent)
- `scan.ebay`, `scan.mercari`, `scan.match`, `scan.enrich`
- `scan.cache.hit` / `scan.cache.miss`

Gated on `SENTRY_DSN` or the existing `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`.  Inert without a DSN.
Traces do not include listing titles, search queries, or desk keys.

- `/` live scan
- `/settings` API keys (browser first; encrypted account backup when signed in)
- `/alerts` deal alerts
- `/saved` ledger
- `/install` native apps (no public APK)
- `/login` Google, Apple, or X
- `/privacy` store privacy page

## Native

See [`native/README.md`](native/README.md).  Both apps talk to eBay, Mercari, and the price desks from the device.

- Android: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose, package `me.grok.dealdex`, launcher name DealDex, Gradle 8.7 wrapper, targetSdk 35.  Assemble locally from `native/android`.  dealdex.net does not host an APK.  Play Console credentials are not in this repo.
- iOS: `native/ios/DealDex.xcodeproj` (XcodeGen spec `native/ios/project.yml`), bundle `net.dealdex`, display name DealDex, team `CC8UTF7ATG`.  Apple bundle resource id `R2FAW69NPD` is not a team id.  ASC app DealDex SKU `dealdex`, appleId `6802474288`.  Internal TestFlight ships via `ios-ship.yml`.

## Valuation

Free desks run without a key.  Paste keys in Settings (web) or Keys (phone).  Conflict means the core desks disagree by more than ~35% — check the dossier before you buy.
