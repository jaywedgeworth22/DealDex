# Current Handoff

## 2026-08-20 GROK — rebase iOS TestFlight ship workflow (#85)

Added `.github/workflows/ios-ship.yml` plus a scheduled-ship gate so cron
cannot ship web-only commits.  Path filter is `native/ios/**`.  Fleet app
key is `dealdex`.  Runner `[self-hosted, macOS, ARM64, xcode26]`.  Secrets
stay on the Mac.  Bundle `online.dealdex` and team `CC8UTF7ATG` are
unchanged.  Android package `me.grok.dealdex` is unchanged.  This seat
does not upload to TestFlight.  Rebased onto current `main`.

## 2026-08-20 CURSOR — shipping docs + GitHub About

Vercel is the current host, not a leftover.  Public host is
**https://dealdex.online**.  GitHub About homepage is that URL, not
`dealdex-psi.vercel.app`.  Repo is **public**.  Keep the site on Vercel.
Do not migrate copy to Coolify.  Native: Android `me.grok.dealdex`, iOS
`online.dealdex`, team `CC8UTF7ATG`.  Docs only.

## 2026-08-19 CURSOR — official DD AppIcon + TestFlight rejects

Home-screen icon is the overlapping glossy red + blue DD with a thick yellow
rim (white background).  iOS has `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon`,
`CFBundleIconName=AppIcon`, and iPad orientations include PortraitUpsideDown
(Apple 90474).  Android adaptive/mipmap launcher and web favicon + PWA 180
use the same DD.  In-app wordmark stays the official title mark (PR #86).
Landed as PR #87.

## 2026-08-19 CURSOR — official DealDex wordmark (in-app / web)

Official title wordmark (red Deal + blue Dex, yellow badge) is the header,
login, Settings "Wordmark" chip, `public/marks/dd.svg`, and OG card
(merged PR #86).

## 2026-08-18 CURSOR — iOS bundle ID `online.dealdex`

Switched the iOS target from `me.grok.dealdex` to `online.dealdex`.  Team
stays `CC8UTF7ATG`.  Apple bundle resource id `R2FAW69NPD` is documented
only.  It is not a team id and must not appear in `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`.
No TestFlight / ASC upload (Jay has not created the ASC app DealDex,
SKU `dealdex`).

# Status

Updated: 2026-08-20 (GROK — rebased #85 iOS ship workflow onto current main)

## Current state

- GitHub: `jaywedgeworth22/DealDex` (public).  Integration tree:
  `/Users/jay/Code/DealDex` stays on `origin/main` (do not edit there).
- Fleet member: acronym **DD**, Slack `repo: DealDex`, live board
  `~/apps/DEALDEX-EFFORT-LOG.md`.
- **Grok Build** (`GROK-BUILD`) is a standing seat.  Prefix `grok-build/`.
- Website is optional.  Stack is React 19, TanStack Start, Tailwind v4,
  Better Auth, Vite.  Not Next.js / Expo / React Native / Capacitor.
- **Public host: https://dealdex.online on Vercel.**  Vercel is current,
  not a leftover.  GitHub About homepage is `https://dealdex.online`.
  Do not point About at `dealdex-psi.vercel.app`.  Do not migrate the
  site to Coolify.
- GitHub `main` is the code.  Vercel Production builds it (team
  `jaywedgeworth22s-projects`, project `dealdex`).  Checked 2026-08-20:
  `https://dealdex.online` served the same hashed JS as the GitHub-linked
  alias `https://dealdex-git-main-jaywedgeworth22s-projects.vercel.app`.
  The older "stale Grok publish, not tracking `main`" gap is not visible
  in today's GET.  Both pages still load
  `grok.com/grok-app-builder/extensions.js` (Grok publish chrome).
- `https://dealdex.vercel.app` is a different Next.js product.  Do not
  use it.
- Native Android debug APK builds with the Gradle 8.7 wrapper.  Package
  remains `me.grok.dealdex`.  Launcher is the official DD.
- iOS XcodeGen spec (`native/ios/project.yml`) uses
  `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=online.dealdex` and
  `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=CC8UTF7ATG`.  Apple App ID `online.dealdex` is
  registered (resource `R2FAW69NPD`, IAP on).  AppIcon catalog is wired;
  `CFBundleIconName` is `AppIcon`.
- In-app / web title mark is the official DealDex wordmark (PR #86).
  Home-screen AppIcon / Android launcher / PWA 180 are the overlapping
  red + blue DD (PR #87).
- iOS TestFlight ship workflow (`.github/workflows/ios-ship.yml`) runs on
  `[self-hosted, macOS, ARM64, xcode26]`, calls
  `scripts/ios-ship-testflight.sh` (fleet key `dealdex`), and gates cron
  on `native/ios/` changes.  Secrets stay on the Mac.

## Blockers

- App Store Connect **app record** for `online.dealdex` (bundle ID is
  registered; App Manager API cannot CREATE apps).  Account Holder must
  add DealDex once (SKU `dealdex`).  Do not upload to TestFlight until
  that record exists.
- Google Play Console credentials are not in `~/.secrets/`.
- Infisical project (prod env), `SENTRY_FLEET_DSN`, and
  `FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN` still need the owner.
- Integration tree `~/Code/DealDex` is dirty (uncommitted
  `native/ios/DealDex.xcodeproj` bits) and behind `origin/main`.  Do not
  fast-forward it until those files are cleaned by a human or an iOS lane.
- `xcodebuild` on the Mac can hang at Xcode 26's `clang -v` probe.
  Fallback: `swiftc` + `simctl` (see `native/ios/CLAUDE.md`).  This
  Linux preview cannot run Xcode 26.

## Next

- Keep the public host on Vercel at `https://dealdex.online`.  Do not
  move copy to Coolify.
- TestFlight / ASC app record when the owner is ready (bundle
  `online.dealdex`, SKU `dealdex`, team `CC8UTF7ATG`).  After that record
  exists, the Mac `ios-ship` workflow (or
  `bash scripts/ios-ship-testflight.sh --force-ship`) can upload.
- Remaining seats start from `main` in their own worktrees.
