# DealDex-local iOS fleet ship copy

Vendored from Congress.Trade `scripts/ios-fleet` so this repo can ship
without `/Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet` on the runner.  `apps.json` here is
DealDex-only: bundle `net.dealdex`, team `CC8UTF7ATG`, SKU `dealdex`,
marketing `1.0.N`, build UTC `YYYYMMDDHHMM`.  `ship-testflight.sh` accepts
the same first-arg keys as Congress/Socratic (`socratic|congress|usage|usage-local`)
plus `dealdex`.  `R2FAW69NPD` is the Apple bundle resource ID, not the team.

`scripts/ios-ship-testflight.sh` prefers this directory, then falls back
to `/Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet` on Jay's Mac.

Secrets stay in `~/.secrets/appstore-connect.env` on the Mac runner.
Do not put ASC keys in GitHub secrets or this tree.

When fleet ship behavior changes, copy `ship-testflight.sh`, `asc-api.mjs`,
`publish-ios-versions.sh`, and the ExportOptions plists from Congress.Trade
and keep this `apps.json` DealDex-only.

`publish-ios-versions.sh` must seed from the live
`jaywedgeworth22/ios-app-versions` `versions.json` (or `--base-json`).
This directory does not carry a full local snapshot.  Publishing
`{apps:{net.dealdex}}` would wipe sibling fleet apps from the shared
manifest the in-app update prompt reads.

## In-app update prompt (pin)

`AppUpdatePrompt.swift` in this directory is the in-repo pin.  Copy it
into `native/ios/DealDex/AppUpdatePrompt.swift`.  Keep the two files
byte-identical.  Do not make a Swift package.  Do not fork behavior.

Apple IDs are not hardcoded in the Swift file.  Live DealDex is
`net.dealdex` / `6802474288` in `apps.json` here and in
`jaywedgeworth22/ios-app-versions` `versions.json`.  The iOS target
also sets Info.plist `AppUpdateAppleId` to that same number as a
local fallback.  Do not treat `online.dealdex` as the live bundle.
